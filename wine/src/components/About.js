        Tasting wine is an experience.  Each bottle you open has a different story and is a different adventure. For the avid wine drinker, understanding the differences in the wine you are drinking and the story of that wine can be a huge aspect of the wine experience. This site is a place to log the wines you have tried and explore what makes that wine taste they way it does.<br/><br/>On top of being able to keep track of each wine you taste, you can also add food pairing suggestions for that wine.  If you try the wine again with a different dish, or if another user wants to add in what they tried, they will be able to provide a description and a link to the recipe.<br/><br/>Wine-About-It aims to be a living document to help you elevate your wine adventures.
