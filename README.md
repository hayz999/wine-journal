## About

This was my first solo full stack application while learning to code at Galvanize.  During my undergrad at the University of Denver I was a Hospitality major learning the in's and out's of the hotel and restaurant industry.  One of my favorite classes while a student was Beverage Management, a course designed to get you to being able to pass the intro level Sommelier certification.  This class taught me about the complex process of creating a good bottle of wine and the huge differences that can become possible with each wine.


Obviously my time in the hospitality world came to an end as I fell in love with coding, but my love for wine and that industry has not ended.  Naturally making an application to track and rate wines you have tried and add recommended food pairings for that wine, seemed like a pretty good idea.

## Technology used

### Backend

The backend was built using Node.js with Express and Knex.  I joined two tables and created a RESTful API.  The GitHub repo for the server can be found [here]('https://github.com/hayz999/wine-server').  Server was deployed to Heroku

### Frontend

The frontend was created using React.js, React Material UI for some style elements as well as plain CSS, and Chart.js for the bar graph. The site was then deployed to Firebase for free hosting.

### E2E testing

Testing for functionality was done with Cypress.
